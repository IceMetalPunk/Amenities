Definite:

1. AirCon, gives slowness to mobs (and players?) in range; turns water into ice.
2. Central Heating, causes regular fire damage to mobs (and players?) in range; melts ice.
3. Electric Lift, redstone-powered elevator block. Shifting mobs go down, non-shifting go up.
4. Televiewer / Telemitter, screen and camera. Somehow. If possible.
    4b. If not possible, then teleportal of some sort.
5. Bathtub (tubthump?), infinite water source
6. Shower, cleans status effects and grows crops
7. Dimminer (dimmer), analog lamp
8. Locked shulker box & shulker key
    --> Like a normal shulker box, but once locked, can only be opened with the exact same key
    --> Keys can be copied; each has a unique ID in its NBT otherwise.
    --> Boxes' TEs track the first key used on them and get locked with that ID.
    --> Shift-click with the correct key fully unlocks the box and allows it to be locked with
        another key, or just publicly opened.
    --> Locked boxes don't allow automation at all, even from hoppers.
9. Digital clock, outputs redstone proportional to time of day, linearly, regardless of daylight

Uncertain:

8. Fan, classic mob fan? Maybe?
9. Rollerboots? Give speed and low friction.
10. Oven, redstone-powered furnace that takes longer but uses no fuel
11. Microwave, expensive, cooks food via redstone and uses no fuel, but has a chance of burning the food as well
